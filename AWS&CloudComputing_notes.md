# AWS and Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing 
- Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT and computing resources over the Internet
- Instead of buying and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud
- Eliminates need to have physical storage

Note: Diagram below shows a visual representation of the cloud

## History and Timeline of Cloud Computing 

1. 1960's - Late Professor John McCarthy sugguested Cloud Computing would be sold as a utility 
2. 1967 - IBM visualised operating systems 
3. 1970's White House installed first computers 
4. 1990's World Wide Web launched, 1million computers connected to internet 
5. 1996 - Cloud in internal document Compaq
6. 2000's Amazon Web Services (AWS) launches public cloud

##  What can you do with Cloud computing 
1. data backup
2. Disaster Recover
3. healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients
4. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention

## Types of Cloud 
1. Public Cloud 
2. Private Cloud 
3. Hybrid Cloud
4. Multiclouds

## Different types of Cloud services
1. Software as a services
2. Infrastructure 
3. Google Cloud
4. Platford as a services 
5. IAAS
6. Computing 
7. AWS
8. Community Cloud 
9. Dropbox

## Advantages of Cloud Computing 
1. Disaster Recovery - businesses can recover quickly
2. Flexibility - Access the data anywhere
3. Mobility - Businesses can work anywhere, location does not matter
3. Low cost - savin businesses money
4. Scalability - scale with demand 
5. Cloud provider handles updates/security - alot of responsibility is with the provider
6. Better security - large businesses can put more resources into security 
7. cost vision/control - much easier to manage costs
8. Resource optimisation - use what you need
9. Global reach - can go global in seconds, disaster redundancy 
10. Business agility - easy to keep up with market trends and business changes 
11. improved collaboration - teams can easily work on the same projects 
12. Economies of scale - bigger organisations can operate at larger scale and pass cost saving on to you/your business 

## Disadvantages of cloud computing 
1. Requires internet 24/7
2. Difficult to migrate 
3. Fixed contracts can be a problem 
4. cost spiralling - easy to overspend with unused servers running in background 
5. data privacy - data is being stored on the internet. Isn't always ideal and you should evaluate if it is suitalbe for you. Also, certain aspects of responsibility will be on you, not just cloud provider
6. resources are still limited 

## What is OpEx vs CapEx?
**CapEx** - Capital Expenditure 
- Capital expenditures are expenditures creating future benefits. A capital expenditure is incurred when a business spends money either to buy fixed assets or to add to the value of an existing asset with a useful life that extends beyond the tax year.
- bigger upfront purchases that affect the business more 
- Pay for what you need

**OpEx** - Operation Expenditure 
- OpEx (Operational expenditure) refers to expenses incurred in the course of ordinary business, such as sales, general and administrative expenses (and excluding cost of goods sold - or COGS, taxes, depreciation and interest).
- shorter, more impactful purchases that are less impactful on the business  
- Opex is better at responding to change

## Marketshare 

**Marketshare** - Market share is the percent of total sales in an industry generated by a particular company
- calculated by taking the company's sales over the period and dividing it by the total sales of the industry over the same period


## What are the 3 largest Cloud providers known for
- Cloud Marketshare:
  - AWS 32%
  - GCP 11%
  - Azure 22%
  - Others 35%

## 4 pillars of DevOps
1. Culture 
2. Automation 
3. Measurement 
4. Sharing 

#### Sparta perspective:    
1. Ease of Use - is it easy to use?
2. Flexibility - industry changes at a fast rate, so do not create systems that rely too heavily on on one app
3. Robustness - uptime, canwe get as close to 99.9% uptime? 
4. Cost
